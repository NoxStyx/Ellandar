Apple 2 code for Ultima 5-like overworld map tech demo

Source originally dates from mid-1987
First version by Beth Daggert

Source contains essentially no comments, information on algorithms 
will be found in separate co-located files if available.

Additional handwritten notes exist which might help to understand implementations, 
if of interest let me know and I'll scan them.
